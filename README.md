## Aim : Building a Chatbot to help with development of the Extinction Solutions Index (ESI)

### Data Collection
Used websites like IUCN Open-Access Libraries, W&M Swem Library Databases, Science Direct, and Conservation Evidence to download research papers and articles. I also used Google Scholar to search keywords like "agriculture pollution", "biodiversity solutions", "biodiversity conservation", "pollution solutions", and "agriculture pollution solutions".
